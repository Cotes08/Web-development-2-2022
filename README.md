# Web-development-2-2022

-In the first project I use ASP and AJAX to create an airline management application, where you can manage passenger reservations, manage planes, manage flights, manage routes, see which flights are between certain routes... I also implement some extra functionalities in the JSP folder.

-In the second project I use PHP and Laravel to create a website that manages a workshop. In this website you can manage customers, vehicles, vehicle parts and generate invoices.

-The third project was an optional research project on web technologies, in this case I chose codeigniter4 and created a local login connected to a database.
